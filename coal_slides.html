# 2019 election results in coal seats

# The LNP performed significantly better in coal seats

- For the purposes of these slides "coal seats" are defined as Flynn, Capricornia, Dawson and Herbert. The Hunter has not been included because the Nationals did not run a dedicated campaign there.

# The LNP specifically targeted coal

- A strategic decision was made to focus heavily on coal and coal jobs. 

- Jobs vied with the cost of living as the most important issue in coal seats.

- Labor's Just Transition Authority policy was a sleeper issue and helped link them to the Greens. Labor's own policy said they would "implement pooled redundancy schemes" for coal miners and coal power station workers.

- A wesbite link was sent out on the day before the election https://laborsplantosackworkers.com/

# The carbon tax played a cameo role

- Regional modelling from Brian Fisher was used in the last week to cement Bill Shorten and Labor as anti-jobs.

# The LNP did well

- The pro-coal campaign run by the LNP has turned four previous marginal seats into safe seats.

# There was a surge for minor parties

- The LNP vote did not suffer from the rise of right wing minor parties. A very different outcome than the first rise of One Nation in 1998.
